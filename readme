This is the code used to:
	-  calculate transsortativity
	-  increase and decrease transsortativity in any network
	-  calculate the freindship paradox in a network
	-  calculate the largest vulnerable component

- 2k_swap_map.cpp  :  Performs 2K-rewiring on the input network (as edgelist) to achieve higher or lower assortativity based on Metropolis alg proposed by Mark Newman.
		      Input: 
		      	- edgelist (change edgelist_file string)
		      Output: new edgelist files with correct transsortativity value
		      "rdmswap_" + count

- 3k_swap_map.cpp  :  Performs 3K-rewiring on the input network (as edgelist) to achieve higher or lower neoghbor assortativity based on greedy algorithm.
		      Input: 
		      	- edgelist (change edgelist_file string)
		      Output: new edgelist files with correct transsortativity value
		      "rdmswap_" + count

- fspdxavg.cpp  : Calculate the transsortativity of the input network (as edgelist)
		  output as [k, r_{3k}(k), p(k)]. 
		  edit input_file = "./Google2"
                  edit output_file = "fspdx.out"
		  mean transsortativity can be calculated with \bar{r}_{3k}. 
		  (Computations of Figure 2 is performed on this code)

- vulnerable.py  :  Find the number of nodes and edges of the giant vulnerable component in the network using the Watts cascade model
		    input: 
		    	- infile: undirected edgelist
			- outfile = './vulnerable.out'
		    output: [1/phi, n_gvul, e_gvul] (Simulations of Figure 4 is performed on this code)
		    (iterates sequentially through range of values of phi)

- zeroone_opt.c  :  Calculate the strength of the friendship paradox (fraction of nodes with friendship paradox) on a series of assignments of attribute x=1 with increasing k-x correlation, and compare with theoretical results based on Eq (2.7). (Simulations of Figure 3 is performed on this code)
                    input: 
		        - input file
			- output file ("of" in the code)
